    "So far research shows that one should use ARIMAX instead of mult-linreg for time series, but I haven't found a good answer for why yet. (S)ARIMAX is a multiple regression model (S for seasonal) with one or more autoregressive (AR) terms and/or one or more moving average (MA) terms. It is part of pdmarima auto-arima. You include the additional regressors as exogeneous regressors. Example is included in the Auto-Arima notebook. \n",

    "Thoughts: Similarly to linear regression, it could be considered risky/irresponsible? to include multiple linear regression for time series forecasting. On the other hand, we could just have the expectation that the user will do their due dilligence? That being said, you have to undo any transformations in your forecast that you applied to your data--since these transformations are specific to the dataset, I don't see multiple linear regression as being realistic/viable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Side note: people will use Vector Autoregression or VAR is a model used to capture the linear interdependencies among multiple time series. It is a type of ARIMAX. In this way a linear modeling approach is incorporated into the pdmarima package. \n",
