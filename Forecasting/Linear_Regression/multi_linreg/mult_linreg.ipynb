    "So far research shows that one should use ARIMAX instead of mult-linreg for time series, but I haven't found a good answer for why yet. (S)ARIMAX is a multiple regression model (S for seasonal) with one or more autoregressive (AR) terms and/or one or more moving average (MA) terms. It is part of pdmarima auto-arima. You include the additional regressors as exogeneous regressors. Example is included in the Auto-Arima notebook. \n",

    "Thoughts: Similarly to linear regression, it could be considered risky/irresponsible? to include multiple linear regression for time series forecasting. On the other hand, we could just have the expectation that the user will do their due dilligence?"
